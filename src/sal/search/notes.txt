Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar
coordinates. Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$
and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id>

## Step 1: Recall the conversion formulas between rectangular and polar coordinates
The conversion formulas between rectangular and polar coordinates are
$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$.

## Step 2: Calculate the radial distance r
Apply the formula to calculate r using the given rectangular
coordinates (0,3): $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = \sqrt{9} = 3$.

## Step 3: Calculate the angular coordinate theta
Apply the formula to calculate theta using the given rectangular
coordinates (0,3): $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)$.

## Step 4: Consider the case where theta is undefined
We need to be careful when $\theta$ is undefined. The point (0,3) does
not lie on the positive x-axis, so the arctangent is undefined for
$\theta$. Instead, we have $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

## Step 5: Determine the final polar coordinates
The final polar coordinates are $\left(3,  \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$.
